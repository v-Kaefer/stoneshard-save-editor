This head teemplate will be kept, since i couldn`t find an alternative to work with a single page and work with "Tabber", as it is currently implemented.<br>
Since tabber, provides a better visualization and organization for the ratios table, the overall structure will only be updated, to work directly with the [[Friendly data]] page, instead of [[CommoditieRatios data]].

='''{{c|+|UPDATES}}'''=


    Current order of commodities:
    Grain;Charcoal;Salt;Timber;Beer;Wine;Cider

The current order differs from the original commodities page.<br>Needs fixing, along with the data page.

    Correct order:
    Sacks of Grain;Barrel of Beer;Crates of Wine;Pails of Cider;Shipment of Timber;Crates of Charcoal;Sacks of Salt
