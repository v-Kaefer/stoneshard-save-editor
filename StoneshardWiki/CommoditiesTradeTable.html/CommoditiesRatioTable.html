'''{{c|+|THIS TEMPLATE IS THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/head}} & {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/row}} TEMPLATE.}}'''<br>
'''{{c|+|ALONG WITH THE [[CommoditiesRatio data|COMMODITIESRATIO DATA]], UPDATED TO THE [[Friendly data|FRIENDLY DATA]] PAGE!}}'''

=Updates=

Firstly, the data found in the old temporary [[CommoditiesRatio data]] page, was added to the [[Friendly data]] page.<br>
'''Therefore, NPCs that had the "Trade=1" parameter, received a new parameter: "Ratios"'''.<br>
That were adjusted from the older order to the new one.<br>

==Data Format==
The new datastring order has 7 data columns separated by semicolons. Each column represents the price of a commodity in a specific town.<br>
Current order of commodities in columns are:

    Sacks of Grain;Barrel of Beer;Crates of Wine;Pails of Cider;Shipment of Timber;Crates of Charcoal;Sacks of Salt

The base values are:
    280;240;360;300;240;300;400



==Usage==
Before, there was th possibility to have different "/head" usages. But, after the "Tabber" implementation, there was really no need for multiple "/head" parameters.<br>
The template has been simplified to simply {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable}}, and "controlled" by "Tabber", to show specific towns NPCs.


==Examples==

==="Clear" Call===
{{CommoditiesRatioTable}}
|}


===Header & row===
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}
|}


==Usage==

{{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/head|town=Osbrook}}*<br>
{{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}

*head can use -> |town=Osbrook
===With Tabber implementation===
<tabber>
|-| Commodities Ratios =
{{#tag:tabber
| All =
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{!}}-{{!}} Osbrook =
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}
{{!}}-{{!}} Mannshire =
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Mannshire|Arenn}}
{{!}}-{{!}} Brynn Inns =
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Brynn Inns|Rico}}
}}
</tabber>


=== New implementation ===
The new implementation used in [[Commodities]], do not define 'town' and uses the <tabber> parser tag, in the page itself, instead of the template.<br>
More information on the <tabber> parser tag, can be found in the [[Stoneshard_wiki:Community_portal|Community Portal]], under "Tabs".
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}
