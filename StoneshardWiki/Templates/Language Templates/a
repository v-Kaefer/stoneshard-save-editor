|Knightly Blade = A single glance at this noble blade is all it takes to realize that only a select few are worthy to wield it.

|Radiant Sword = In the times of the Radiant Wars, many high-born lords were more than happy to join King Etbert's army. Some did it to earn the Host's favor, others - for more practical reasons, such as glory and new riches.

|Elven Saber = Some of the local aristocrats favor eastern sabers over traditional Aldorian swords - despite any weird looks they get from their subjects.

|Boarding Hatchet = A weapon of choice among the corsairs of the Bronze archipelago, utterly indispensable during boardings.

|Brynn Hatchet = A weapon of rank, proudly carried by captains of the Brynn garrison. The way they strut about with these axes on their belts is a sight to behold.

|Norse Axe = A traditional weapon of Fjall clans, first adopted by the guards protecting the Northern Borderlands and then - by the rest of the kingdom.

|Dwarven Axe = If there's anything that dwarves appreciate more than booze and looting, it's a good axe.

|Heavy Broadaxe = It's not easy to handle a weapon this massive, but the strikes that actually connect are bound to be deadly.

|Noble Axe = No armor can resist a blow dealt with such a monstrously heavy axeblade.

|Exquisite Tabar = A tabar is a symbol of maafs, the warrior estate which holds the most power in the Ahjat Empire. Even the nobility require a special permission to arm themselves with one.

|Footman Axe = A perfectly balanced axe - it's light enough to be swung with relative ease while still packing the weight to hack through armor and shields.

|Mercenary Axe = Over the last few decades, Aldorians have attained incredible mastery in forging heavy plate armor. Axes like this are simply an attempt at evening the odds.

|Knightly Axe = Such axes are well-suited for mounted combat. Aldorian knights often choose them over the rest of their arsenal when they ride into battle.

|Aldwynn Axe = Aldwynn smiths are known for two things: crafting the heaviest and the most durable armor in Aldor and forging arms that can chop through it.

|Baron Axe = For the longest time, Aldorian nobles had been rather dismissive towards axes. Their perspective took a turn when the late King Etbert introduced a fashion for richly decorated axes, turning them into a symbol of power.

|Spiked Club = A simple wooden mace, bristling with imposing spikes. The wounds it leaves are less than pleasant.

|Reinforced Club = Clubs like this one are often employed by city guards - don't need anything more substantial to intimidate a pickpocket.

|Soldier Club = Despite being more dangerous than a simple makeshift club, it's still no real mace.

|Skadian Bludgeon = A bludgeon is a surprisingly deadly piece of gear. If anyone knows their maces, it's Skadians.

|Veteran Mace = A reliable weapon which doesn't require much skill or maintenance, an easy choice for many common soldiers.

|Druzhyna Bludgeon = The Elder Prince's druzhyna doesn't give ground even in the face of insurmountable odds. It's most distinguished members may receive a great privilege - a gift of an honorary weapon granted personally by the Prince.

|Morgenstern = A hit or two, and this morgenstern will be the last star your enemy will ever see.

|Voivod Mace = Maces are held in great regard in Skadia, where even high-born military commanders don't scoff at using them on the battlefield - although this particular weapon looks somewhat ceremonial in nature.

|Cudgel = A crude club for a crude peasant.

|Militia Club = "Peasants call these clubs """"snails"""" - the headpiece is fashioned into a curly shape for some extra heftiness, allowing it to crack open subpar armor."

|Flanged Mace = What's the main advantage of flanged maces? They don't get stuck when they crush skulls and plate armor.

|Shishpar = A shishpar is a flanged mace used by soldiers of Jibey and the Maaf Empire. It particularly excels at punching through scaled armor, which is quite popular in those lands.

|Reinforced Flanged Mace = A mace that offers the best value for its price - it's simple, easy to wield, and utterly lethal.

|Bozdogan = Bozdogans weren't always a maaf weapon - the design was adopted from nomads of conquered Jarimad.

|Knightly Flanged Mace = This flanged mace was forged by someone with a creative mindset. Thankfully, the unusual shapes chosen for its head and handle don't retract from the weapon's deadliness or ease of use.

|Noble Flanged Mace = With the exception of Aldwynn weaponsmiths, there aren't that many craftsmen in Aldor who can produce a mace of similar quality.

|Ornate Flanged Mace = It's clear as day that the master smith, who meticulously crafted this weapon, put his heart and soul into it. The lord ordering it must have had money to spare.

|Footman Warhammer = A hammer that can punch a hole in even the heaviest of plates. At the same time, there are much better options if your opponent is poorly armored.

|Chekan = Skadian warhammers are forged to last and are sought after even outside of their country of origin.

|Ornate Warhammer = The sentiment that maces are a weapon of the peasantry is long obsolete. Adorned with gold and horsehair, this warhammer demonstrates it better than anything.

|Peasant Flail = During peacetime these flails are used to thresh wheat. During wartime - to chase off marauding deserters.

|Militia Flail = Village militias are called upon only as a last resort. And when the going gets dire, even a farming tool can become a weapon.

|Spiked Flail = As the common folk like to say, a spiked flail is the final argument of peasants.

|Veteran Flail = Flails are devastating in experienced hands, capable of inflicting terrible injuries.

|Knightly Flail = "Flails are considered to be a weapon of the low-born, but sometimes they are used by lords as well. Such """"noble"""" flails are crafted with quality in mind."

|Three-Headed Flail = A risky weapon for those who are confident in their skill.

|Elven Flail = Elven flails serve mostly a ceremonial purpose, carried only by the most skillful of warriors to flaunt their status. No money is spared to make these weapons look the part.

|Iron Bar = Getting smacked with this thing is not something one can easily walk off.

|Carpenter Hammer = An ordinary hammer that can also be used to pull out bent or errant nails.

|Blacksmith Hammer = It's almost asking to be put to work.

|Commoner Dagger = The common folk have no right to own swords, and since axes and clubs can't be comfortably tucked into a belt, a dagger is the most obvious option for a peasant to pick.

|Shiv = A makeshift blade wrapped in a piece of cloth. A common weapon of urchins and vagabonds.

|Bollock Dagger = As gamblers like to say, always keep an ace up your sleeve and a dagger down your boot.

|Recruit Dagger = A crudely reforged hunting knife suitable for butchering game and slitting throats.

|Footman Longsword = These swords can improve your chances when fighting a heavily armored opponent, making them a popular choice among common foot soldiers.

|Mercenary Longsword = As mercenaries like to jest, the longer the sword, the shorter the opposition.

|Sergeant Longsword = A well-made sword, forged from good steel and completely bereft of any trifling decorations.

|Noble Longsword = It could have easily belonged to either a small-time baron or a duke - basically the kind of person who doesn't skimp on expanding their arsenal.

|Ornate Longsword = The blade is inscribed with words of dedication to one Idrich Jorg of Aldwynn.

|Warbrand = It's sharp to such a degree that a strong enough strike will easily separate your opponent's head from their body.

|Claymore = Initially these swords were used only by the nobility of the Firn foothills, but now they can be found all over Aldor.

|Flamberge = A flamberge's wavy blade deals such dreadful wounds, that the voices for prohibiting it outright grow louder with each passing day.

|Grossmesser = In the eyes of the law, a grossmesser is just a very, very big knife rather than a sword - yet another attempt at circumventing the restrictions of the Aldorian estate system.

|Captain Greatsword = For a mercenary warband's captain, a greatsword isn't just a weapon but a proof of their rank and combat experience. And if they need to spend some extra gold to make it stand out, then so be it.

|Blademaster Greatsword = Swordmasters are paid double wages to fight on the frontline - and they don't need to be asked twice to demonstrate why this expense is well-founded.

|Vanguard Two-Hander = The backbone of the Magistrate's army, the Vanguard, is formed by mercenaries. A decent pay, plentiful drinks, and honorary swords make for a surefire way to earn the loyalty of the dogs of war.

|Dueling Two-Hander = Single combat with two-handed swords is a form of art, where your reflexes and precision matter just as much as brute strength.

|Sergeant Two-Hander = A weapon often used by sergeants of the Magistrate. Such blades aren't cheap but definitely worth it.

|Knightly Two-Hander = This two-handed sword was created with pure functionality in mind: its strength lies in perfect simplicity and great balance.

|Exquisite Two-Hander = The handle makes this sword's origins crystal clear - Brynn weaponsmiths have a soft spot for elegant and somewhat ostentatious detailing.

|Espadon = Despite the strict isolation, some goods still get smuggled from the Bronze Isles to Aldor. A lot of the time the contraband includes various swords: if anything, the islanders have had a lot of practice crafting weaponry.

|Peasant Spear = A modest homemade spear that comes in handy when hunting boars.

|Hilda's Spear = Hilda crafted this spear herself from the debris washed ashore after the shipwreck. Her hands remember every scratch and groove on the weathered shaft.

|Hunting Spear = A scourge of bears, this weapon can take down even the largest game.

|Goedendag = To the knightly estate's great displeasure, this modest peasant weapon is perfectly capable of piercing even quality plate armor.

|Spontoon = Another great example of the Bronze Isles craftsmanship, where a weapon's aesthetics is prized just as much as its killing potential.

|Spear of the Faceless = The Faceless are the Royal Guard of the Jacinth Kingdoms and are considered to be the best warriors in that part of the world. Among other things, they distinguished themselves on the frontlines of the Radiant Wars by breaking the advance of King Etbert's army.

|Militia Spear = It doesn't take much time to learn how to use a spear efficiently. For this very reason, it became almost synonymous with peasant militias.

|Footman Spear = Its main purpose is to halt the enemy cavalry in its tracks, and it does so with flying colors.

|Norse Spear = The dwarves of Fjall rarely use spears in combat, deeming them a hunting weapon, unworthy of the battlefield.

|Veteran Spear = As one prominent Aldorian commander used to say, wars are waged by knights but are won with spears. Spears like this one.

|War Pitchfork = There isn't a single agricultural tool which hasn't been repurposed for military use.

|Mancatcher = An indispensable tool for pinning down fugitives and wild beasts, it can often be seen in the hands of bounty hunters.

|Brandistock = A brandistock is a fairly uncommon weapon which is sometimes issued to sergeants of the Road Guard.

|Fauchard Fork = When it comes to inventing weapons for killing their own kind, the creativity of people never fails to achieve new heights.

|Spetum = Unlike a common pitchfork, a spetum has its prongs pointed at different directions, which makes them much more suitable for catching enemy blades.

|Guard Halberd = These halberds are typically forged from poor steel: city guards don't see a lot of action.

|Footman Halberd = A halberd is beloved by the Aldorian infantry for its versatility. Being able to use your weapon for both slashing and thrusting attacks is a valuable asset on the battlefield.

|Mercenary Halberd = Halberds were originally a mercenary weapon, so their widespread use among the Grand Magistrate's soldiers is hardly surprising - at least half of them hail from free companies.

|Sabre Halberd = There are two kinds of halberdiers: those who favor thrusting and those who favor slashing. But in case you want to do both, this is a weapon for you.

|Guisarme = It's said that Aldorian smiths got the idea of forging such a peculiarly shaped weapon from the inhabitants of the Bronze Isles.

|Billhook = Every now and then, the clergy and nobility consider outlawing this weapon - with a billhook in hand even a greenhorn can stand his ground against the heavy cavalry.

|Scorpion Halberd = "This halberd's name comes from its vague resemblance to a scorpion's tail and the ability to deliver equally painful """"stings""""."

|Militia Poleaxe = A home-made axe on a long pole - this weapon sees frequent use in the hands of the Gray Army.

|Soldier Poleaxe = Such poleaxes are forged by the Council weaponsmiths with less metal than usual, allowing for cheaper production.

|Veteran Poleaxe = An axe capable of cleaving open both the laminar armor of maaf riders and the breastplates of Nistrian cataphracts.

|Sergeant Poleaxe = Poleaxes started to gain popularity in Aldor not long before the war, as the need to combat the increasing use of heavy armor had been becoming more and more apparent.

|Knightly Poleaxe = Aldorian knights are slow to accept novelty, but the numerous advantages of poleaxes can persuade even the most stubborn.

|Captain Poleaxe = It takes no small amount of training to wield a heavy poleaxe, but if you have what it takes, there's almost no match to its penetrative power.

|Recruit Heavy Broadaxe = Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that this poleaxe was inspired by Skadian bardiches.

|Soldier Heavy Broadaxe = It takes a truly impressive amount of strength and stamina to handle this axe efficiently.

|Nistrian Bardiche = It didn't take long for Fjall dwarves to adopt Skadian bardiches. And thanks to their mercenaring varangs, this weapon shape became known to Nistrians as well.

|Eederax = When the Aldorian army was routed by the Nistrian cavalry at the battle of Thorny Hill, the Eeders militia took the humiliating defeat to heart and started attaching special anti-cavalry hooks to their axes.

|Garrison Eederax = A heavier version of an eederax: the traditional hook became a part of the axeblade itself.

|Skadian Bardiche = Skadian bardiches are a weapon of status. Only the greatest warriors - the champions and the retinue of Skadian princes - are allowed to carry them.

|Doloire = "The doloire is also known as a """"wagoner's axe"""". It's often carried by caravaneers tasked with escorting military wagons."

|Voulge = A predecessor to halberds, a voulge is still occasionally used by guards and some militias.

|Militia Bill = It would be impossible to count how many noble lords had their lives cut short by this outrageously unassuming peasant weapon.

|Jagged Voulge = All these spikes offer plenty of options: can use them to intercept an incoming strike, pull down a rider from their horse, finish off a wounded opponent...

|Skadian Sovnya = This weapon can often be seen in the hands of Skadian horsemen. They weren't the ones who first started using it though: Skadians borrowed the design from the Poleds, a tribe inhabiting the shores of the Icy Sea.

|Glaive = Even though it bears a resemblance to a spear, thrusting with a glaive is not very effective - it's basically a broad sword attached to a shaft.

|Forholt Staff = It hails from the area around Forholt, where it was once carried by mounted guards. Contrary to its name, this weapon has more in common with a bardiche than a staff.

|Ornate Voulge = The stamp of the Guild makes it safe to assume that this voulge was intended for some high-ranking Magistrate commander.

|Lumberjack Axe = This axe is great for felling trees. It fares only slightly worse when used for chopping heads.

|Militia Longaxe = Gather a group of peasants, provide them with a handful of longaxes and a clever sergeant, and even a better-equipped opponent might find itself stumped on how to deal with the resulting force.

|Footman Longaxe = While many will deny it, Aldorians actually learned a few things from dwarves - how to make such axes, as an example.

|Veteran Longaxe = It's hard to imagine armor which would protect from a direct hit with this axe.

|Orient Longaxe = Jarimad nomads fight on foot only when there's no other option, but when they do, they rely on these axes - the design proved its usefulness through many battles against the heavy maaf infantry.

|Double-Headed Longaxe = Despite its formidable appearance, this axe is rather unwieldy in a real fight.

|Elven Longaxe = Longaxes are exotic to elven lands - the peoples of Jacinth who use them can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

|Exquisite Longaxe = A longaxe is a highly unusual choice for a ceremonial weapon. And by the looks of the decorations, the original owner shelled out a pretty sum for it.

|Peasant Scythe = When a peasant war is about to erupt, a scythe is as good a weapon as any.

|Recruit Polemace = A single solid strike from this polemace will make your enemy forget even their own name.

|Soldier Polemace = If blunt force alone isn't enough to get through your opponent's armor, this polemace also has a spike for precise jabs to the neck.

|Veteran Polemace = The mace head is shaped in such a way that it's equally effective against both lightly and heavily armored opponents.

|Nistrian Polemace = Constant wars with Aldor left a deep mark on Nistrian warfare. Naturally, they've become quite successful at combating heavily armored troops.

|Knightly Polemace = Well-suited for fighters who want their every strike to leave the opponent in the dirt.

|Exquisite Polemace = Don't let the glint of gold mislead you: despite its elegant ornaments, this polemace shatters skulls and bones just as efficiently as its plain counterparts.

|Militia Polehammer = Looks like it used to be a common hammer until some smith reinforced it with additional metal and put it on a longer shaft.

|Kriegshammer = Can break one's jaw just by trying to spell its name.

|Mercenary Polehammer = Among the Magistrate mercenaries, polehammers are almost as widespread as halberds.

|Veteran Polehammer = The convenience and versatility of these polehammers garner them praise from the veteran soldiers of both the Council and the Magistrate.

|Hawk's Beak = There aren't that many helmets or cuirasses which can survive a strike from a three-pronged hammerhead.

|Knightly Polehammer = Polehammers have recently begun to rise in popularity as a weapon of choice for knightly jousts.

|Brynn Polehammer = A line of soldiers bristling with such polehammers is a force that can threaten even the heavy cavalry. Especially the heavy cavalry.

|Honorary Polehammer = It looks like one of the polehammers awarded by Duke Arno di Berro to captains of the Falcon Plume company for their display of heroism during the defense of the Northern Gates.

|Ornate Polehammer = A customary weapon of the Royal Armorbreakers - a renowned guard unit currently employed in the service of the Council.

|Large Club = A weapon tested by millennia of hunting and gathering.

|Heavy Warclub = Even though a strike from this club is unlikely to harm a well-armored opponent, it still has all the chances to briefly knock the wind out of them.

|Reinforced Warclub = A few rows of spiked iron bands is certainly one way to add to your weapon's heftiness.

|Spiked Warclub = It's best not to find yourself on the receiving end of this warclub - its strikes not only shatter bones but also leave deep puncture wounds.

|Veteran War Maul = Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one - this maul is a testament to it.

|Knightly War Maul = This weapon is a world apart from the tool which originally inspired it - a humble pickaxe.

|Elven War Maul = "Elves call this hammer shape a """"bull horn"""" for the distinctive spike on its back end."

|N/A = N/A

|Long Flail = A lucky hit from such a flail can squash a cheap helmet along with the wearer's skull.

|N/A = N/A

|Maen Flail = The majority of the Cowls, the fanatical followers of Neer, are former peasants, so it comes as no surprise that their favorite weapon is a heavy flail.

|N/A = N/A

|N/A = N/A

|N/A = N/A

|N/A = N/A

|Peasant Bow = These bows can often be found in possession of some particularly bold peasants, who secretly hunt on their lord's land.

|Guard Bow = A perfect example of a weapon's effectiveness relying entirely on the user's skill: this bow is pretty much useless in the hands of a novice archer.

|Soldier Bow = In order to master a bow, you need to start training from childhood - a usual practice in most Aldorian villages.

|Norse Bow = Dwarves don't hold much respect for bows. They are usually handed out to youngsters who aren't experienced enough to fight on the frontline.

|Aldorian Bow = Has enough power to knock a charging knight from his saddle.

|Nomad Shortbow = A bow of Jarimad nomads, intended to be shot from the saddle.

|Skirmisher Shortbow = Whittling the enemy down with agile maneuvering and constant arrow barrages from a safe distance is the preferred tactic of the Nistrian light infantry.

|Curved Shortbow = This bow's curved shape allows it to send arrows further and with more precision than usual, though it has a bit of a kick which takes time to get used to.

|Soldier Longbow = As the boastful proverb goes, as long as Aldor has at least a dozen longbows, it'll remain unconquered.

|Eeders Longbow = The production process for these famous longbows isn't exactly common knowledge - the denizens of Eeders tend to keep to themselves.

|Carved Longbow = It was most likely crafted for a wealthy Royal Ranger, who had been granted a fief for his loyal service.

|Relict Longbow = This marvelous artifact appears to be at least millennia old. It's a mystery how it hasn't yet rotted away.

|Training Crossbow = It's significantly easier to learn how to use a crossbow than a bow, but there's no avoiding practice either way.

|Hunting Crossbow = Crossbows are well-suited for hunting - their accuracy and stopping power leave little chance even to large animals.

|Soldier Crossbow = A crossbow used by both sides of the conflict - it's equally popular with the soldiers of the Council and the mercenaries of the Magistrate.

|Maen Crossbow = Soldiers of the Maen garrison hold a deep appreciation for simplicity, light weight, and convenience. This crossbow combines all three qualities in its design.

|Aldwynn Crossbow = A while ago, His Lordship Brodwyn der Razen made it his personal mission to fit his soldiers with crossbows of this design. His success inspired some other prominent Council commanders to eventually do the same.

|Orient Crossbow = Exquisite carvings, smooth curves... Everything about this crossbow betrays its elven origins.

|Brynn Crossbow = The Falcon Company is one of the most infamous detachments of the Magistrate's army. Their crossbows were fashioned by master craftsmen of Brynn in the likeness of elven bolt throwers.

|Carved Crossbow = Any weapon has a potential to be transformed into an object of art. It's the age of redundancy after all.

|Belt Hook Crossbow = Rather than relying on your arm strength alone, the belt hook also allows to engage back muscles when drawing the string, which makes reloading this crossbow noticeably less tiring.

|Cranequin Crossbow = A cranequin is a cunning mechanism which made crossbows even more deadly than they had already been. At least a dozen engineers and master craftsmen from all over Aldor compete for the title of its original inventor.

|Mercenary Crossbow = A crossbow fitted with a more sophisticated cranequin than usual, allowing for a noticeably smoother reloading process.

|Garrison Crossbow = These crossbows are excellent at taking out siege engineers even when shooting over large distances

|Guard Crossbow = Village guards are usually recruited from peasantry, where most are already familiar with a bow. As for town guards, it takes much less effort to arm them with crossbows than teach them archery from scratch.

|Pull-Lever Crossbow = Reloading a crossbow with a lever offers much greater convenience without sacrificing the weapon's draw weight.

|Windlass Crossbow = Spend a few months actively using this crossbow, and even village fair strongmen will envy your muscles.

|Siege Crossbow = The brutal killing power of this crossbow gave birth to rumors that even soldiers hiding behind mantlets aren't safe from the bolts launched with it.

|Guardsman Crossbow = Not too long before his demise, King Etbert ordered to form a unit of crossbow-wielding guardsmen. The most skilled Aldwynn bowyers were tasked with providing the weaponry, but they'd managed to produce only a few dozen crossbows before the monarch's death.

|Healer Staff = Some Aldorian healers place special enchantments on their staves, much to the displeasure of village priests.

|Monk Staff = Aldorian monks' staves are blessed by the Host themself to help the faithful endure the hardships of daily toil and distant travels.

|Dwarven Staff = The headpiece in the form of a sea leviathan is carved with such attention to detail that it looks like it could start spewing flames at any moment.

|Hierophant Staff = These staves, still bearing the mark of the Host, are the main proof of the clerical estate's divine patronage.

|Skadian Staff = Distant Skadia is notable for its powerful spellcasters, known as volkhvs. There must be quite a story to this staff.

|Spellweaver Staff = The ranks of Spellweavers only accept the best of the best - even prominent Academy mentors often find themself snubbed and rebuked.

|Farseer Staff = The multiple attempts to marry Hieronite teachings with elven rituals produced a number of prominent Aldorian saints capable of glimpsing into the future - nevertheless, most of the clergy rejected this path, branding it as a perversion of the church traditions.

|Traveling Staff = Any journey feels easier with a staff in hand.

|Pilgrim Staff = A trusty companion for long journeys between holy sites.

|Reinforced Staff = With enough dexterity, this staff's heavy knob is all you need to beat the living daylights out of a slow-witted brigand.

|Battlemage Staff = Seemingly cumbersome, this steel staff is actually quite light. It's also a great conduit for magical energies.

|Geomancer Staff = A staff fashioned from nigh indestructible stone, yet somehow is still weighs lighter than wood.

|Cryomancer Staff = Cryomancers love to joke about this staff's bone-chilling properties. The last time anyone laughed at this pun was a century ago.

|Arcanist Staff = Don't even try prying the enchanted amethyst out of this staff's headpiece - that is unless you want to spend the rest of your life outside of this plane of existence.

|Gilded Warstaff = As far as one can tell, this staff was originally meant for an Aldorian battlemage of some importance: the gaudy decorations belie a potent design, aimed to assist with both martial and spellcasting endeavors.

|Axonian Warstaff = Hundreds of years ago, this boar-shaped piece was carried at the head of countless battle-hardened phalanxes.

|Hermit Staff = The reclusive Sages are long-time protectors of Aldor, yet very little is known about them. There seems to be a growing rumor that many of them have disappeared without a trace over the past few years.

|Vampiric Staff = This staff saturates the surrounding air with a heavy stench of stale blood.

|Cammock = So withered that it's almost impossible to think of any good use for it.

|Hexer Staff = A tree branch, darkened from age and covered with strange etchings - simply looking at it fills you with a sense of deep-seated anxiety.

|Witch Staff = Witch staves have two primary uses: to sustain the life of their owner and to cast the most brutal of hexes.

|Sorcerer Staff = After surviving the Academy and the first handful of battles, most mages usually seek to invest their earnings into a proper staff.

|Necromancer Staff = Necromancers aren't bereft of a sense of humor, albeit theirs comes with a morbid twist: most of them find joy in desecrating graves of the clergy, using harvested skulls as a decoration for their staves.

|Pyromancer Staff = The spherical headpiece radiates extreme heat, which, paradoxically, doesn't seem to cause any harm - at least for the time being...

|Electromancer Staff = The Pyromancy Circle used to spread malicious rumors that the death of Frid Konnoken, the founder of the Electromancy Circle, was caused by him foolishly allowing a similar staff to come in contact with a street puddle.

|Astromancer Staff = "Astromancers claim such staves to possess an astonishingly precise ability to model the motion of our... What do they call it? Right, our """"planet""""."

|Court Mage Staff = This enchanted staff's headpiece was designed for conducting all types of magic.

|Orient Staff = At the end of the day, few things can beat fine elven craftsmanship: it clearly took a lot of skill to create a staff this magnificent.

|Shackles = A set of shackles with a short chain. The bracelets dig viciously into the skin, hindering arm movements and making it difficult to even lift a spoon to one's mouth.

|Chain = A chain is a weapon of street and tavern fights, hardly suitable for real combat.

|Lute = Be it Aldorian troubadours, Nistrian vagantes, or elven gusans - a lute is beloved by minstrels all over the world. Recently it made its way even to Fjall, although not every skald was happy with such a frivolous turn of events. Many of them refuse to play the instrument, deeming it a major threat to their long-established craft and musical tradition.

|Pickaxe = These pickaxes see use all over the realm, from the gold mines of Forholt to the convict quarries of the Northern Borderlands.

|Sickle = Sickles are generally wielded by women and children - during the harvesting season, they are tasked with cleaning up patches of grain that were missed during scything.

|Broom = Your main ally in the never-ending struggle for tidiness and order.
