==Usage==

{{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/head|town=Osbrook}}*<br>
{{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}

*head can use -> |town=Osbrook

==Examples==
=== Previous usage ===
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head|town=Osbrook}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Brukk}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Bert}}
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/row|Osbrook|Jurg}}

=== New implementation ===
The new implementation used in [[Commodities]], do not define 'town' and uses the <tabber> parser tag, in the page itself, instead of the template.<br>

'''{{c|+|THIS TEMPLATE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO WORK WITH [[Friendly data|FRIENDLY DATA]].}}'''<br>
'''{{c|+|ALONG WITH THE [[CommoditiesRatio data|COMMODITIESRATIO DATA]], UPDATED TO THE [[Friendly data|FRIENDLY DATA]] PAGE!}}'''

==Commodities Ratio Table==

This is the template for the Commodities Ratio Table. It is used to generate the table on the [[Commodities]] page.

=Updates=

Firstly, the data found in the old temporary [[CommoditiesRatio data]] page, was added to the [[Friendly data]] page.<br>
'''Therefore, NPCs that had the "Trade=1" parameter, and trade [[Commodities|commodities]] received a new parameter: "Ratios"'''.<br>
That were adjusted from the older order to the new one.<br>

==Data Format==
The new datastring order has 7 data columns separated by semicolons. Each column represents the Ratio of said commodity for a specific NPC.<br>
Sacks of Grain;Barrel of Beer;Crates of Wine;Pails of Cider;Shipment of Timber;Crates of Charcoal;Sacks of Salt

The columns are in the following order:

    OLD ORDER: Grain;Charcoal;Salt;Timber;Beer;Wine;Cider
    OLD Base : 280  ;300     ;400 ;240   ;240 ;360 ;300

    NEW ORDER: Grain;Beer;Wine;Cider;Timber;Charcoal;Salt
    NEW Base : 280  ;240 ;360 ;300  ;240   ;300     ;400

==Usage==
Before, there was the possibility to have different "head|{{x}}" usages. But, after the "Tabber" implementation, there was really no need for multiple parameters.<br>
The idea was to simplify the template to simply {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable}}, and "controlled" by "Tabber", to show specific towns NPCs. But tabber would end up requiring repeated code blocks, therefore killing the purpouse of it.



==Examples==

==="Clear" Call===
{{CommoditiesRatioTable}}

===Header & row===
{{CommoditiesRatioTable/head}}

*head can use -> |town=Osbrook
===With Tabber implementation===
