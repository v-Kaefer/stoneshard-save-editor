'''Ingredients''', along with [[Materials]], are items intended to be used for [[crafting]]. As the latter is not implemented in game yet, all ingredients are able of being used only as [[consumables]].

* Herbs can be commonly found growing on the [[Plains]] or bought from [[Frid]], the herbalist. Most herbs provide beneficial effects for a limited amount of time.
* Mushrooms can be commonly found near trees in the [[Forests]]. Mushrooms classified as Ingredients are usually poisonous and shouldn't be eaten raw. Edible and cooked mushrooms are classified as [[Food]].
* [[Pine Cone]]s can also be found near trees in the Coniferous Forests. There is currently no use of them.
* [[Stick]]s multiple can be found near trees in the Forests. They can be used to lit a [[Campfire]].
