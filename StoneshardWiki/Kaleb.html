Feel free to mention me on the wiki channel, if you need help with any of the templates i made.<br>
But i always try to leave good documentation on each one of them.

Quick disclaimer (that you should already know if you intend to contribute to the wiki), this is a community wiki, i don't own any of these templates and anyone can modify them.

== TO DO ==

=== PT-BR Translation ===

Here's a list of all the templates that exist(or not) for other languages:

{{tl|PT-BR Properties}} (75%) [INCOMPLETE & Needs better organization]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ItemNames}} (95%) [Updated to RtR and organized. Needs some last revision comparing the translations and game names.]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ItemDescriptions}} (25%) [Swords & Axes DONE]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ConditionNames}} BASE (05%) [contains condition names]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ConditionDescriptions}} (05%) [contains condition names]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ConsumableNames}} (05%) [contains consumable names]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ConsumableDescriptions}} (00%)<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ValuableNames}} (99%)[DONE + DOCS -> Needs Revision]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR ValuableDescriptions}} (90%) [Needs Revision]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR Treatises}} (100%) [DONE + DOCS]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR WikiNavigation}} (90%) [Needs Revision]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR NPCNames}} (80%) [A couple NPCs missing]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR SkillNames}} (95%) [Needs Revision with game names]<br>
{{tl|PT-BR SkillDescription}} () []<br>
{{tl|PT-BR SkillFormulaDescription}} () []<br>

And the Language templates category page, lists templates where translation is applicable. So in theory, anything that uses one of those templates should get translated.<br>
(conditions are what we used to call status effects at some point).

=== CommoditiesRatioTable ===
It’s separated in {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/head}} & {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable/row}}.<br>
There is no more need for it, since it’s being used with <Tabber>.<br>
 - Remove head & row pages.
 - Simplify to a single page {{tl|CommoditiesRatioTable}}.


=== ContainerTable ===
This template needs modifying for a method to display Treatises, since a container can drop multiple Treatises, without a lot of repetition.<br>
And i also made [[Container data]], for better testing, this needs to either be maintained or implemented as another parameter, probably verifying each item type from a parameter called "Loot", for example, and display them accordingly.<br>
Therefore, this Template, should follow {{tl|Acquired from}} Template updates, for better integration, and less repetition on data & pages with the same things.
 - Better method to display Treatises
 - Decide to keep or implement somewhere else or to each item, in their own data pages.
 - Keep a look at {{tl|Acquired from}}, for better integration of both, since they are correlated.
